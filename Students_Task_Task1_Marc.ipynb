With this ticket, you are able to take regional trains and busses within Germany for 9€ per month. You're taking the chance and plan a city trip through Germany. Since you don't want to spend too much time in the trains to have more time in the cities, you want to optimize your traveling route. \n",

We provide you with the basic code structure, which includes the classes ```Ant``` and ```AntColony```. You will have to add your implementation marked with *## add your code here*. We also provide brief descriptions of what should be implemented at those positions. For the relevant formulas, we would like to refer to the presentation slides regarding **Ant System**.\n",

    "Our implementation further makes use of the classes ```View```, ```Node```, ```Edge```, ```Graph```, ```Germany```. You can view those as helper classes contained in the file ```graph.py```. You do not have to do anything in that file."

    "Your initial population consists of 50 group distributions, where 100 students are assigned to 20 groups. Each student has a Student ID, a name, their spoken language, their 2 Majors (we assume everyone is doing their Masters), their ambition in the course, their preferred meeting place, their personality type, their gender, a friend that they want to be in a group with, and their preferred meeting day. \n",

To do so, you simply have to execute the Jupyter Notebook named \"Dataset_Input.ipynb\". We are using the Myers-Briggs personality, which may not be the most scientific, but it for sure is entertaining.
